# download-pictures-automatically
a program about downloading pictures automatically using java

I'm not very good at English,so this is a brief introduction about this program.

The file of html-body.html is used to save the urls of pictures.We can download pictures by analysising these urls. At the beginning,I don't kown the pattern of the url,so I create this file to show urls.Of course,now the program can get urls by analysising a String which is corresponding to this file.

Src file has two folders.I have downloaded lots of picture using program in http file.You need to input a website and the number of threads in Main.java.I search pictures by Baidu or Chrome.In public static void VistPage(String url , int num) method,you must have corresponding driver to connect with different browsers and pay attention to its version as it may cause an error.Another folder is Qzon which is used to download pictures in QQ moments like Facebook.If you need to download pictures,http file is the best choice.
